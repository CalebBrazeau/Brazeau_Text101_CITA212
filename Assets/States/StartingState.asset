  strStoryText: 'You wake up with a bag over your head, the bag is ripped off and
    as your vision clears you see you''re in an empty room with a person standing
    infront of you.

    He throws a document onto your lap with "Confidential"
    stamped in big red letters across the front.

    You slowly reach up and grab
    the document.

    Before opening you glance up at the scary man staring at
    you, he nods with approval.

    Opening the document you see pictures of a
    moon base supposedly located on the dark side of the moon.

    The man starts
    talking in a high pitched girly voice, he says " We suspect that base was recently
    attacked by an unknown assailant. We need someone to go down and assess the situation
    and report back on what happened."
