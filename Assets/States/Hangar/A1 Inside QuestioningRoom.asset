  storyText: 'You wake up with a bag over your head, the bag is ripped off and as
    your vision clears you see you''re in an empty room with a person standing infront
    of you.

    He throws a document onto your lap with "Confidential" stamped
    in big red letters across the front.

    You slowly reach up and grab the document.

    Before
    opening you glance up at the scary man staring at you, he nods with approval.

    Opening
    the document you see pictures of a moon base supposedly located on the dark side
    of the moon.

    The man starts talking in a high pitched girly voice, " We
    suspect that base was recently attacked by an unknown assailant. We need someone
    to go down and assess the situation and report back on what happened."
